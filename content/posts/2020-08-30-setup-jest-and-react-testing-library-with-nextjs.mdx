## 1. Install your dependencies

We're going to be install the recommended React setup with:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Jest DOM](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- [babel-jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/babel-jest)

To install them run:

```sh
yarn add -D @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react babel-jest jest
```

## 2. Set up Babel

Here we need to explicitly tell Babel to use the Next.js Babel preset so Jest doesn't get confused. Create a `.babelrc` file and add the following:

```json
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"]
}
```

## 3. Set up Jest

First, make sure Jest has been added to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file. Here's an example of what `package.json` should look like when you're done.

```json
{
  "name": "your-app-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "latest",
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "react-dom": "^16.13.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.11.4",
    "@testing-library/react": "^10.4.9",
    "babel-jest": "^26.3.0",
    "jest": "^26.4.2"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Once that's done, you need to set up `jest-dom`. Create a `jest.setup.js` file and add:

```js
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
```

Once you've added it to the setup file, create a `jest.config.js` file to make sure `jest.setup.js` is loaded in correctly. Inside the config file add:

```js
module.exports = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["./jest.setup.js"],
};
```

Creating a setup file allows you to use it in all your tests without needing to import `jest-dom` into every test file directly. You can just add it once and forget about it.

It's also important to note that there is nothing special about the `jest.setup.js` file name. In other projects, you'll see that it's called `setupTests.js`, but you can call it whatever you like.
Just make sure that the file name matches what you add to `setupFilesAfterEnv`.

### (Optional) Configure ESLint with Jest

If you're using an `.eslintrc` file then you need to make sure it gets configured correctly too.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "jest": true
  }
}
```

### (Optional) Make Jest aware of abolute path aliases

If you're using [absolute imports or module path aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases) in your project (which you should), then you will need to do a little extra setup to make Jest aware of them.
Inside of your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file, you might have aliases like:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["components/*"],
      "@pages/*": ["pages/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["hooks/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

To make sure Jest knows how to resolve these paths, you can use the [`moduleNameMapper`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#modulenamemapper-objectstring-string--arraystring) property in your `jest.config.js` file.

```js
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["./jest.setup.js"],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    "^@components(.*)$": "<rootDir>/components$1",
    "^@pages(.*)$": "<rootDir>/pages$1",
    "^@hooks(.*)$": "<rootDir>/hooks$1",
  },
};
```

If your path aliases are different, then you will need to modify the regex key for each of your aliases.

## 4. Set up React Testing Library

Create a folder for handling all your test related code. I called mine `test`. Inside the `test` folder, create a `test-utils.js` file for handling all the custom utilities you'll need to run the tests.
This isn't strictly required, but it will make it easy to add `Providers` and other test utilities later.

```js
// test-utils.js
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";

// Add in any providers here if necessary:
// (ReduxProvider, ThemeProvider, etc)
const Providers = ({ children }) => {
  return children;
};

const customRender = (ui, options = {}) =>
  render(ui, { wrapper: Providers, ...options });

// re-export everything
export * from "@testing-library/react";

// override render method
export { customRender as render };
```

## 5. Write your tests

Here's an example of how you would test a simple `HomePage` component with the current setup. Pretend you have the following `HomePage` component with just a heading.

```jsx
// pages/index.js

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Testing Next.js With Jest and React Testing Library</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

Here's what a test would look like

```jsx
// test/pages/index.test.js

import React from "react";
// Using render and screen from test-utils.js instead of
// @testing-library/react
import { render, screen } from "../test-utils";
import HomePage from "@pages/index";

describe("HomePage", () => {
  it("should render the heading", () => {
    render(<HomePage />);

    const heading = screen.getByText(
      /Testing Next.js With Jest and React Testing Library/i
    );

    // we can only use toBeInTheDocument because it was imported
    // in the jest.setup.js and configured in jest.config.js
    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
