excerpt: You have used yourArrayOfData.map to create an array of components, but how is it rendered without looping through each element?

Let's say you have an array of product data that you want to convert to a component and display. Here is an example of what that data could look like.

```js
export default [
  {
    id: "some-random-id-1",
    name: "Can of Beans",
    price: 8.99,
    description: "Beans that will change your life.",
  },
  {
    id: "some-random-id-2",
    name: "Naruto's Ramen",
    price: 28.99,
    description: "Official ramen taken straight from the anime.",
  },
];
```

After getting that code into your App component, you use `items.map` to create an array called productComponents that stores each Product component. After passing the entire array into a div, React somehow displays all the components _without_ needing to loop! **Why does this work?**

```jsx
import items from "./products.js";

const Product = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{props.name}</h3>
      <p>{props.price}</p>
      <p>{props.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => {
  const productComponents = items.map((item) => {
    return (
      <Product
        key={item.id}
        name={item.name}
        price={item.price}
        description={item.description}
      />
    );
  });
  return <div>{productComponents}</div>;
};
```

The answer is simple: **JSX automatically converts an array of components into elements.**

With vanilla JavaScript, you _would_ need to loop through each element and add it to the HTML document, but JSX is smart enough to display them **automatically**. Since React is using JSX under the hood, you get that functionality completely for free!

For more information and a few more examples: take a look at the React documentation for [displaying lists](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html).
