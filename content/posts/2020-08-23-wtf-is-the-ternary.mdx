Let's use an example.

Say you want to shorten some text that is longer than 40 characters. First we'll need to check if the text
has more than 40 characters. If it does, we'll take the first 40 and drop the rest. Otherwise we'll just keep the original text. Let's make a function
that will do exactly that.

```js
function shortenLongerThan40(text) {
  if (text.length > 40) {
    // return a substring starting from the 0 index up to the 40th character
    return text.substr(0, 40);
  } else {
    // if it is shorter than 40, we just give back the original text
    return text;
  }
}
```

Here I just checked if the string has more than 40 characters `text.length > 40` and used [the `substr` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring)
to take care of shortening the string. The ternary operator can be used here to make the code even shorter.

```js
function shortenLongerThan40(text) {
  return text.length > 40 ? text.substr(0, 40) : text;
}
```

Both functions will give you the same output, but the ternary operator let's you do it **in one line**. So how does it work?

The trick to understanding the
ternary operator is to imagine it as just an `if-else` block. Let's break down the `if-else` block from the first example, and
compare it to the second.

```js
function shortenLongerThan40(text) {
  //  condition
  if (text.length > 40) {
    // what to return if true
    return text.substr(0, 40);
  } else {
    // what to return if false
    return text;
  }
}
```

The `if-else` block has 3 parts:

- The condition
- What to do when it's true
- What to do when it's not

The same is true for the ternary operator except we just add in some symbols to separate the 3 parts.

```js
function shortenLongerThan40(text) {
  //     condition        ? if it's true       : if it's false
  return text.length > 40 ? text.substr(0, 40) : text;
}
```

Now we are immediately returning a value based on the `text` length. When using the ternary, the **condition** goes _before_ the `?` and the value you want to return if it's true comes _after_.
Everything after the `:` is the `else` statement.

Let's use another example to drive this home. Say we want to make a function that simulates flipping a coin. Some logical steps to accomplish could be:

1. Get a random number between 0 and 1
2. Check if the number is less than 0.5
3. If it's true, return `"Heads"`, otherwise return `"Tails"`

Let's code out this logic using an `if-else` block and a ternary statement. First, here's the `if-else` version:

```js
function simulateCoinToss() {
  if (Math.random < 0.5) {
    return "Heads";
  } else {
    return "Tails";
  }
}
```

Now compare that to a function that gives the same output using the ternary operator:

```js
function simulateCoinToss() {
  return Math.random() < 0.5 ? "Heads" : "Tails";
}
```

Both get the job done, but the ternary statement provides a concise way to accomplish the same goal.
