How to get started:

- Go narrow (find a very specific niche) and kill it
  - You can always expand later
  - Master a single language
  - Master a single framework
  - Make projects and document well
    - Documentation is far more important than the project itself
    - The project is to help you learn, the documentation is to communicate what you know
- Expand your network
  - Let people know what you do by sharing what you do
  - Talk and help others
  - It's not about who you know, it's about who knows you

Path to profitability

- WIP: Learn and document the entire process
  - Master a medium of content creation
  - Own the platform you create on
    - Have your own blog/portfolio
      - Gatsby works
      - Wordpress also works
  - It's more important to create than anything else
